## Proposed Title

Removing the Barrier to Entry: The Future of Identity Is Here 

## Structure

* A brief introduction to the history of Identity
* A brief primer on digital identity
* Modern challenges in the identity space 
* What is self-sovereign identity and why do we need it
* ERC-725 to ERC-1056
* A vision for the future (e.g., World Bank ID4D, the ID2020 Alliance, and Identity for good initiative)

## Why You Want to Write This

In addition to those who lack an ID (estimated to be over a billion), most of the world does not have access to or control over a digital identity that is an aggregate of who they are and what they’ve done. 

Ideally, we’d be able to locally store attested data pieces about our health records, government records, financial records, academic history, physical attributes, social circle and so forth on a Self-sovereign Identity platform that we own and operate. This identity can then be used to apply for visas, jobs, onboarding, and global financial (KYC/ AML) compliance. These records already exist, but they are in silos, spread across a variety of vulnerable platforms that we do not control.

Identity is a significant friction in the world and there are a number of initiatives working towards solving it. I’d like to write a paper in an effort to bring more attention to the matter and engage communities of developers and curators to work on it.

## Why Someone Should Read This

The audience I have in mind are those who are curious about the possibilities offered by the Ethereum ecosystem and have some background in tech – not necessarily as a developer. Technology enthusiasts, who are trying to see what programming language to learn next and whether solidity would make sense.
So, given the audience, they will read it because it tells them what they can do with the technology today, and something larger to get inspired by and work towards.
